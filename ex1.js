// my teacher said that he knows the performance issues of foreach, but the syllabus is teaching this so here we are i guess

	// another way you can do this is by checking if the number is bigger than 6.
	// { x+6 | x âˆˆ U }
	// if we know that the set consists of values that have an addition of 6, with the lowest possible being 1, we know that the lowest in set B is bigger than 6, but within U
  // but again the syllabus wants us to use this other method

	// 2) make sure the values, after being multiplied by 3 is a part of set U
